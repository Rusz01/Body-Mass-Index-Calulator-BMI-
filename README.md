<p>This program calculates the Body Mass Index and shows the respective category of BMI based on their weight and height. Weight is measured in kilograms and height is measured in meters. After the Body Mass Index is calculated, the user’s category of weight is displayed such as “healthy”, “underweight”, “overweight” or “obese”. I did this program simply using if-else statement.</p>
